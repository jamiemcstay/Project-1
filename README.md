## Project Planning

>I decided to make a website on a fictional rock band and did some research into some popular bands and how their websites looked.


![Screenshot of websites referenced in planning stage of website](/assets/images/research/website-research.png  website-research.png)

After researching I began a UX design plan that was in line with what I had seen across numerous of the websites that I had reviewed.


## Strategy

### Website visitors

> Are existing fans of the band.
> Are visiting the website to learn more about the band and are potential fans.
> Want to be able to hear about tour schedule.
> Want to be to have access to the bands music.
> Want updates on anything new that happens with the band.

### Musicians/Bands

-  Want to promote promote their music.
-  Want to promote their touring schedules.
-  Want to increase their fanbase and listener base.
-  Want to keep vistors/fans updated in anything happening with the band. 

## Scope

- The website should contain a navigation menu, main content areas on each page and a footer.
- It should contain an area that promotes new music. 
- There should be some imagery of the band on the website.
- There should be information on the website about touring schedule.
- Visitors should be able to listen to the bands music.
- There should be a way that fans can opt in to more integrate themselves within the bands community.

## Structure

I decided that the scope of the project could be met with three pages on the website:

- Home
- Tours
- Music

Across all pages as is consistent on websites, there will be a consistent header with responsive naviagation bar, a main content area, and a footer that contains a form where fans can sign up to a newsletter. 

### Homepage

- Should serve as a summary of where the band are at currently and the most recents developments as a band.
- Should contain a welcome section/hero section that highlights the most recent development the band would like to promote in the context of a new album release or a tour. 
- Should contain some imagery of the band. 

### Tours

- Will serve as a page where visotors can view tour dates, check availability of ticktets, and be able to buy tickets for upcoming shows. 

### Music

- Will allow visitors to be able to listen to the music of the band.
- Will allow visitors to watch videos of the band. 

## Skeleton

I used figma to build a wireframes of the different pages on the site. I decided to design the website mobile first.

### Homepage

- Will feature an initial section thats promotes the most recent update about the band such as an album release or upcoming tour.
- Will feature some imagery of the band.
- Will feature a couple of tour dates with a link to the tours page where more dates can be seen. 

### Tours page
- Will feature a list of upcoming tour dates locations, dates and options to purchase tickets.

### Music page

- Will feature some of the bands music that the visitors can listen to.
- Will feature some videos of the band that the visitor can watch. 

## Surface

### Typography 

When designing the surface plane in figma, I had used
- Krona 1 font
- Inter

However, when making the real website I preferred the look of inter as a font on its own, so I used that soley.

### Color

To allow for the site to meet the requirments in terms of accessibity and having a good contrast ratio, I opted to use colors that I knew would stand out from each: 
- Black 
- Red (or eventually rgb(180, 0, 0))
- White.
